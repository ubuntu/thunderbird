# How to report a security issue with the thunderbird snap

The easiest way to report a security issue is through [GitHub](https://github.com/ubuntu/thunderbird/security/advisories/new).
See [Privately reporting a security vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)
for instructions.

The [Ubuntu Security disclosure and embargo policy](https://ubuntu.com/security/disclosure-policy)
contains more information about what you can expect when you contact us
and what we expect from you.
